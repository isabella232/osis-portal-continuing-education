"    <p>Dear Student,</p>\n"
"    <p>The Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) provides its "
"students with a smartcard to access a growing\n"
"        number\n"
"        of functions (to access buildings, car parks, computer rooms, …\n"
"        For more information: https://uclouvain.be/fr/decouvrir/smartcard."
"html).</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>Do you already have a smartcard?<br/>\n"
"        [ ] NO,<br/>I don’t have a UCLouvain access card yet; in this case I "
"have enclosed a photograph in accordance\n"
"        with the\n"
"        instructions below.<br/>\n"
"        [ ] YES, I already have a UCLouvain access card (issued only by the "
"Office of the Registrar or the UCLouvain\n"
"        Human Resources\n"
"        Department); in this case, I have checked the box and enclosed this "
"form with my enrolment application\n"
"        WITHOUT a photograph.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        In order to make these smartcards, we need to obtain a colour "
"photograph from each student in accordance with\n"
"        very precise requirements; these requirements are identical to those "
"for\n"
"        renewing an identity card or passport, i.e.:<br/>\n"
"        - Colour photograph taken by a professional photographer "
"(photocopies, computer printouts, etc. are not\n"
"        acceptable)<br/>\n"
"        - Passport size photograph measuring 35 x 45 mm<br/>\n"
"        - Photograph with a white background (photographs with a coloured "
"background are not acceptable)<br/>\n"
"        - Recent photograph of excellent quality<br/>\n"
"        - The photograph must be carefully glued in position (photographs "
"attached using Sellotape, staples, etc. are\n"
"        not acceptable)\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        any photograph supplied that does not meet these specific criteria "
"will not be accepted (see example on\n"
"        https://uclouvain.be/fr/decouvrir/smartcard.html).<br/>\n"
"        In this case, it will not be possible to order an access card, which "
"may make it difficult for you to complete\n"
"        various procedures within the University. To avoid any "
"inconvenience, please make sure that you:<br/>\n"
"        - affix an appropriate photograph in the box provided below for this "
"purpose (a photograph of the right size\n"
"        should cover the grey rectangle)<br/>\n"
"        - attach this document, duly completed, to your enrolment "
"application.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>No reminders will be issued.</p>\n"
"    <p>The access card will be sent to one of the addresses provided to "
"Office of the Registrar when you enrol.\n"
"        If an address in Belgium has not been provided during enrolment, the "
"card must be collected from\n"
"        the Office of the Registrar (at the start of the new academic year) "
"within ten days of receipt of\n"
"        the enrolment notice.</p>\n"
