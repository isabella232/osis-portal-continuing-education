"        <p>Dear Student,</p>\n"
"        <p>The Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) provides its "
"students with a smartcard to access a growing number\n"
"            of functions (to access buildings, car parks, computer rooms, …\n"
"            For more information: https://uclouvain.be/fr/decouvrir/"
"smartcard.html).</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>Do you already have a smartcard?<br/>\n"
"        [  ] NO,<br/>I don’t have a UCLouvain access card yet; in this case "
"I have enclosed a photograph in accordance with the\n"
"            instructions below.<br/>\n"
"        [  ] YES, I already have a UCLouvain access card (issued only by the "
"Office of the Registrar or the UCLouvain Human Resources\n"
"            Department); in this case, I have checked the box and enclosed "
"this form with my enrolment application\n"
"            WITHOUT a photograph.\n"
"        </p>\n"
"        <p>\n"
"        In order to make these smartcards, we need to obtain a colour "
"photograph from each student in accordance with\n"
"            very precise requirements; these requirements are identical to "
"those for\n"
"            renewing an identity card or passport, i.e.:<br/>\n"
"        - Colour photograph taken by a professional photographer "
"(photocopies, computer printouts, etc. are not acceptable)<br/>\n"
"        - Passport size photograph measuring 35 x 45 mm<br/>\n"
"        - Photograph with a white background (photographs with a coloured "
"background are not acceptable)<br/>\n"
"        - Recent photograph of excellent quality<br/>\n"
"        - The photograph must be carefully glued in position (photographs "
"attached using Sellotape, staples, etc. are not acceptable)\n"
"        </p>\n"
"        <p>\n"
"        any photograph supplied that does not meet these specific criteria "
"will not be accepted (see example on\n"
"            https://uclouvain.be/fr/decouvrir/smartcard.html).<br/>\n"
"        In this case, it will not be possible to order an access card, which "
"may make it difficult for you to complete\n"
"            various procedures within the University. To avoid any "
"inconvenience, please make sure that you:<br/>\n"
"        - affix an appropriate photograph in the box provided below for this "
"purpose (a photograph of the right size should cover the grey rectangle)<br/"
">\n"
"        - attach this document, duly completed, to your enrolment "
"application.\n"
"        </p>\n"
"        <p>No reminders will be issued.</p>\n"
"        <p>The access card will be sent to one of the addresses provided to "
"Office of the Registrar when you enrol.\n"
"            If an address in Belgium has not been provided during enrolment, "
"the card must be collected from\n"
"            the Office of the Registrar (at the start of the new academic "
"year) within ten days of receipt of\n"
"            the enrolment notice.</p>\n"
